# TCL Navigation & Tools Extension

Enhance your TCL coding workflow in VS Code with advanced navigation features and code insights. This extension provides a comprehensive suite of tools that work with your TCL code to help you jump between procedures, namespaces, and variables, and keep your code organized.

## Features

- **Document Outline:**  
  Quickly see a structured outline of your TCL file, including procedures, namespaces, and variables. Navigate your code with ease.

- **Jump-to Definition:**  
  Click on a symbol (like a procedure or variable) and jump straight to its definition. No more searching through your code manually.

- **Code Folding:**  
  Collapse and expand blocks of code, such as procedures, control structures (if/else, loops, etc.), and namespaces, making it easier to focus on what matters.

- **Hover Information:**  
  Get helpful details when you hover over symbolsâ€”see procedure signatures, variable values, and more right in your editor.

- **Sticky Scrolling:**  
  Keep your context in view as you scroll, so you never lose track of where you are in your code.

## Note

This extension **does not** provide syntax highlighting or basic TCL language support. For those features, you will need to install another TCL extension of your choice that handles syntax highlighting and TCL language registration. Use this extension in tandem with your favorite TCL extension to get the full coding experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Install a TCL Syntax Highlighter:**  
   Make sure you have a TCL extension installed that provides syntax highlighting and language registration.

2. **Install TCL Navigation & Tools:**  
   Find and install this extension from the VS Code Extension Store.

3. **Enjoy Enhanced TCL Coding:**  
   Open a TCL file, and you'll see an updated document outline, improved code navigation, folding, and hover details right away.
