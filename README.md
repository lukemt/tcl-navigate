# TCL Navigation & Tools Extension

ATTENTION: No syntax highlighting is provided by this extension. You will need to install another TCL extension that provides syntax highlighting and language registration.

## Features

- **Document Outline:**  
  Quickly see a structured outline of your TCL file, including procedures, namespaces, and variables. Navigate your code with ease.

- **Jump-to Definition:**  
  Click on a symbol (like a procedure or variable) and jump straight to its definition. No more searching through your code manually.

- **Code Folding:**  
  Collapse and expand blocks of code, such as procedures, control structures (if/else, loops, etc.), and namespaces, making it easier to focus on what matters.

- **Hover Information:**  
  Get helpful details when you hover over symbolsâ€”see procedure signatures, variable values, and more right in your editor.

- **Sticky Scrolling:**  
  Keep your context in view as you scroll, so you never lose track of where you are in your code.

## Note

Use this extension in tandem with your favorite TCL extension to get the full coding experience.

   Find and install this extension from the VS Code Extension Store.

3. **Enjoy Enhanced TCL Coding:**
